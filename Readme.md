### 🚀 About Me

I’m a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence engineer with a deep interest in building ethical, explainable, and emotionally-intelligent systems.

> Whether it's decoding human emotion through machine learning or aligning AI models with moral reasoning — I bring systems to life that understand more than they compute.
